## Purpose
This document outlines the procedure for detecting, responding to, and notifying authorities and users in case of a personal data breach, as required by the Digital Personal Data Protection Act, 2023 (DPDP Act).

## 1. Detection

### Monitoring Sources
- Supabase Database Logs (auth events, RLS violations)
- Vercel Runtime Logs (unusual errors, 5xx spikes)
- Upstash Redis (rate limit violations)
- User reports (support@abhartbrands.com)
- Third-party reports (security researchers, breach databases)

### Detection Triggers
- Unauthorized database access
- RLS policy bypass
- Service role key exposure
- Account takeover attempts
- Unusual login patterns

## 2. Assessment

Within **24 hours** of detection:
1. Identify what data was affected (PII, orders, credentials)
2. Determine number of users affected
3. Assess risk severity (low / medium / high / critical)
4. Document the incident in a private log

## 3. Containment

Immediate actions:
1. Revoke compromised API keys (Supabase anon/service, Upstash token)
2. Rotate database passwords
3. Force logout all users (Supabase Auth)
4. Block suspicious IPs
5. Take affected services offline if necessary
